# -AUTOMATED-TOLL-COLLECTION-SYSTEM
Created an Automated Toll Collection System using RFID and computer vision, optimizing traffic flow and enhancing toll booth efficiency. Implemented a secure payment process to reduce congestion and improve transportation experience.
Electronic Toll Collection (ETC): ETC is a fundamental feature of automated toll collection systems. It enables vehicles to pass through toll booths without stopping by using electronic tags or transponders. These devices are usually mounted on the vehicle's windshield, and toll charges are automatically deducted from a prepaid account associated with the tag.

Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID): RFID technology is often employed for electronic toll collection. RFID tags on vehicles communicate with toll booth equipment using radio waves, allowing for quick and efficient toll processing.

License Plate Recognition (LPR): In situations where vehicles do not have ETC tags, LPR technology can be used to capture images of license plates. The system then associates the license plate information with the registered owner's account for toll billing.

Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC): DSRC technology facilitates communication between toll collection infrastructure and vehicles equipped with compatible transponders. It is commonly used in electronic toll collection systems.

Back-Office System: A centralized back-office system manages the entire toll collection process. This includes account management, transaction processing, customer service, and reporting. It ensures accurate billing and provides a platform for customer support.

Toll Plaza Infrastructure: Physical toll booths are equipped with sensors, antennas, cameras, and other devices necessary for toll collection. These components work together to identify vehicles, process transactions, and enforce toll payment.

Prepaid Accounts and Payment Gateways: Users typically maintain prepaid accounts linked to their electronic tags. Toll charges are automatically deducted from these accounts. Online portals and payment gateways facilitate account management and top-ups.

Integration with Traffic Management Systems: Automated toll collection systems may be integrated with broader traffic management systems to monitor and optimize overall traffic flow on highways.

Enforcement Mechanisms: To ensure compliance, ATCS may incorporate enforcement mechanisms such as license plate recognition for toll evaders, electronic warnings, and penalties.

Data Security and Privacy Measures: Given the sensitive nature of personal and financial data involved in toll collection, robust security measures are implemented to protect user information and transactions.
